	+ those walls!!\n
	+ Now, slacker!
     8	= This darkness makes\n
	+ me feel so gloomy\n
	+ and depressed...\n
	+ It's been this way\n
	+ ever since our Shine\n
	+ Sprites went away!\n
	+ This is your fault!\n
	+ And you don't even\n
	+ look apologetic!
     9	= It was weird being\n
	+ stuck in that goop.\n
	+ It was gross, but...\n
	+ I gotta admit, it\n
	+ was kind of sweet.\n
	+ Kind of like candy...

	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
     c	= Running around and\n

	+ sweaty! Yes sir!
     d	= Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
     e	= What's that?\n

	+ happen! But where?!\n
	+ Where is it?!
     f	= It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this the daytime?\n
	+ Are all cities dark?
    10	= Now, where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    11	= Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    12	= I still wish the sun\n
	+ would return, but\n
	+ who needs a tan?
    13	= So, you're probably\n
	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    14	= Don't get all high and\n
	+ mighty with me! You\n
	+ swim like a stone!
    15	= Back off! I know for\n
	+ a fact that you can't\n
	+ swim a stroke, either!
    16	= The boat's finally\n
	+ moving again!

	+ still baking my\n
	+ noodle, I tell you!
    18	= I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
