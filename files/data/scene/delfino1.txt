     0	= Oh, sir, are you\n
	+ leaving us already?\n
	+ \n
	+ Please do reconsider!\n
	+ Stay with us for\n
	+ just a while longer.
     1	= I lost it when I heard\n
	+ this was a four-star\n
	+ resort! I mean, c'mon!\n
	+ Water damage in the\n
	+ restrooms? That is\n
	+ SO low class!
     2	= Hey, you! Have you\n
	+ lost your mind?!\n
	+ \n
	+ You can't just barge\n
	+ into a lady's room!\n
	+ It's just not done!\n
	+ Get out! OUT!\n
	+ Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
     3	= This hotel is outfitted\n
	+ with the finest auto-\n
	+ lock system available.\n
	+ Security here is\n
	+ top-notch! No\n
	+ worries at all!\n
	+ We do have trouble\n
	+ getting around,\n
	+ however...
     4	= My apologies, but the\n
	+ casino is not open for\n
	+ business quite yet.
     5	= Yes, sir! We can meet\n
	+ all of your fruit\n
	+ needs! What'll it be?\n
	+ Eh? Pineapple? Oh...\n
	+ Hm, that's odd... I had\n
	+ some this morning...
     6	= A very unusual egg\n
	+ arrived today. Who\n
	+ could it belong to...?\n
	+ Ah! By any chance,\n
	+ is this yours, pal?
     7	= Eeeek! What are you\n
	+ doing in here?!\n
	+ \n
	+ The men's room is on\n
	+ the other side!!
     8	= I get a really creepy\n
	+ vibe from this...\n
	+ weird painting.\n
	+ But you want to know\n
	+ what I find even\n
	+ creepier than that?\n
	+ ...Imagining how\n
	+ you got in here!
     9	= S-S-Suddenly, a \n
	+ g-g-ghost came out\n
	+ of the c-c-closet!
     a	= Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
     b	= Do something about\n
	+ these ghosts!\n
	+ \n
	+ ...And get out of\n
	+ my room, you weirdo!
     c	= Wait a minute! Where\n
	+ did you come from?\n
	+ I'm calling for help!
     d	= Now, where did I put\n
	+ that thing...\n
	+ \n
	+ Hey, have you seen\n
	+ a pineapple anywhere\n
	+ around here?
     e	= Oh, hi there!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ My door's open, and\n
	+ there's nothing to\n
	+ be suspicious of...\n
	+ How about a game of\n
	+ jacks? Ha ha ha ha!
     f	= Umm, er, yeah...right.
    10	= Hey, you! No one in\n
	+ the pool without\n
	+ proper swimwear!!!
    11	= Hey! That sparkle!\n
	+ Could it be a\n
	+ Shine Sprite?
    12	= All these ghosts are\n
	+ causing such trouble...\n
	+ They're everywhere!\n
	+ Why can't someone\n
	+ come along and suck\n
	+ 'em up with a vacuum?\n
	+ What? Why are you\n
	+ looking at me\n
	+ like that?
