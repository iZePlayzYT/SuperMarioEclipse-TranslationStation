     0	= Hellooooo sweetie!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ You may know my\n
	+ husband, Big Daddy\n
	+ of Blooper Surfing.\n
	+ I'm Big Momma of\n
	+ Booty Scooting, and\n
	+ I own this slide!\n
	+ If you can survive and\n
	+ make it to the end,\n
	+ there's a prize waiting!\n
	+ I'll even give you a\n
	+ \z{7ff,400}secret prize\z{7ff,0} if you can\n
	+ beat the course record.\n
	+ Good luck!
     1	= They call me\n
	+ \z{7ff,300}Belly the Kid\z{7ff,0}!\n
	+ That's my mom.\n
	+ Heads up, mister- if\n
	+ you need to quickly\n
	+ pick up some speed...\n
	+ Try a dive, or a belly\n
	+ slide! Sometimes your\n
	+ booty just won't cut it.
     2	= Hellooooo sweetie!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I see you have\n
	+ returned to my Booty\n
	+ Scooting Course.\n
	+ You should have\n
	+ plenty of practice\n
	+ booty scooting now...\n
	+ If you can finish this\n
	+ course before \z{7ff,400}1:40:00\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ passes on the timer...\n
	+ You will win a \z{7ff,400}secret\n
	+ prize\z{7ff,0} for beating the\n
	+ booty scooting record!\n
	+ Good luck!
     3	= The secret prize Mom\n
	+ is referring to, is a\n
	+ \z{7ff,400}Shine Sprite\z{7ff,0}.\n
	+ She wants you to beat\n
	+ the record by only\n
	+ booty scooting...\n
	+ However, I think \z{7ff,200}belly\n
	+ sliding\z{7ff,0} would make\n
	+ things much easier!\n
	+ After all, she won't\n
	+ know as long as you\n
	+ don't tattle on me!
     4	= What are you doing\n
	+ sweetie? The clock\n
	+ is ticking away!\n
	+ Don't you want to\n
	+ win a \z{7ff,400}prize\z{7ff,0}? Hurry!
     5	= Huh? Are you scared?\n
	+ Belly sliders are not\n
	+ scaredy-cats!\n
	+ If you are going to\n
	+ be a scaredy-cat...\n
	+ \n
	+ Don't go belly sliding\n
	+ to ruin my reputation!\n
	+ I'm watching you.
