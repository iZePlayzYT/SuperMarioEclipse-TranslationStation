     0	= Mario! E. Gadd\n
	+ is projecting us\n
	+ back in time!
     1	= Ah, Master Mario!\n
	+ It's exciting, isn't it?\n
	+ \n
	+ A history lesson you\n
	+ can actually visit!\n
	+ Smashing, I say.\n
	+ By the way,\n
	+ Professor E. Gadd\n
	+ informed me...\n
	+ The time-space tear\n
	+ only exists around\n
	+ Delfino Plaza...\n
	+ So you can't visit\n
	+ other places you\n
	+ normally could.\n
	+ However, he made\n
	+ sure to remind me\n
	+ to tell you...\n
	+ There might be new,\n
	+ hidden areas within\n
	+ the plaza walls.\n
	+ Take a look around,\n
	+ Master Mario!...\n
	+ \n
	+ I'm sure E. Gadd\n
	+ accidentally let some\n
	+ Shine Sprites in here.
     2	= Mario! There you\n
	+ are! Time travel is\n
	+ weird, huh?\n
	+ I think Peach and\n
	+ Toadsworth wanted\n
	+ to speak to you...
     3	= Mario! I can see\n
	+ you in the past!
     4	= The fruit market sure\n
	+ was a lot messier\n
	+ back in the day!\n
	+ Why don't you help\n
	+ clear the boxes away?
     5	= Even though I'm\n
	+ just a projection...\n
	+ \n
	+ I can still get stuck\n
	+ in the goop! What\n
	+ a scam!
     6	= This place looked\n
	+ a lot different in\n
	+ the past, Mario!
     7	= Hey there, stranger!\n
	+ Say, this is your first\n
	+ time here, right?\n
	+ Well, let me officially\n
	+ welcome you to\n
	+ Delfino Plaza!\n
	+ Don't mind the mess\n
	+ in Bianco Square...\n
	+ \n
	+ There was an\n
	+ accident earlier, but\n
	+ I can assure you...\n
	+ We are working hard to\n
	+ get it taken care of!\n
	+ \n
	+ Yup, working very\n
	+ hard indeed...
     8	= Hey, mister! I hope\n
	+ you enjoy your visit!\n
	+ \n
	+ By the way, we try\n
	+ to keep Isle Delfino\n
	+ very, very clean...\n
	+ So if you see any\n
	+ graffiti artists around...\n
	+ \n
	+ Let us know an'\n
	+ we'll send 'em\n
	+ packing!\n
	+ There was a paint\n
	+ shipment accident\n
	+ in the square...\n
	+ And we're doing\n
	+ everything we can to\n
	+ clean it it up! Really!\n
	+ But, uh... If you've\n
	+ got the time...\n
	+ \n
	+ You mind helping out\n
	+ a bit? Ya look like the\n
	+ kind to lend a hand.\n
	+ Of course though,\n
	+ don't cause trouble\n
	+ yourself, mister!\n
	+ We take the Shine\n
	+ Sprites very seriously.\n
	+ \n
	+ We're determined to\n
	+ see all trouble-makers\n
	+ be served justice!
     9	= Apparently, there\n
	+ hasn't been anyone\n
	+ in the jail for 6 years.\n
	+ Regardless of what\n
	+ they tell you...\n
	+ \n
	+ The police don't do\n
	+ much in this town.\n
	+ \n
	+ It's mostly just petty\n
	+ squabbles here\n
	+ and there...\n
	+ Right now they're\n
	+ dealing with the paint\n
	+ in Bianco Square.\n
	+ If only there were\n
	+ some huge scandal\n
	+ going on...\n
	+ I'm sure the plaza\n
	+ would get a lot more\n
	+ attention!
     a	= I just need to buy\n
	+ some fruit for lunch\n
	+ tomorrow.\n
	+ But with the chaos\n
	+ the fruit market is\n
	+ in right now...\n
	+ I think I'll just buy\n
	+ some fish from\n
	+ Ricco Harbor.
     b	= Hey there! I'm\n
	+ just taking my\n
	+ daily jog.\n
	+ It's been 4 months\n
	+ since I stared running\n
	+ through the town.\n
	+ And I don't intend to\n
	+ change my route\n
	+ anytime soon!
     c	= Where's my shipment\n
	+ of coconuts and\n
	+ durians?!\n
	+ It was supposed\n
	+ to arrive today!\n
	+ \n
	+ It better not be mixed\n
	+ up in all those crates\n
	+ over there!
     d	= These aren't my\n
	+ pineapples...\n
	+ \n
	+ I ordered some\n
	+ special peppers.\n
	+ \n
	+ They're super spicy,\n
	+ and I'm sure they'll\n
	+ sell like crazy!\n
	+ But they haven't\n
	+ arrived yet...
     e	= Nothing really exciting\n
	+ happens around here.\n
	+ \n
	+ Wake up, go to work,\n
	+ sell bananas, count\n
	+ my coins, go home...\n
	+ I wonder if my life\n
	+ will change much in\n
	+ the future...
     f	= This is a pretty big\n
	+ mess, I tell ya!\n
	+ \n
	+ But it's not gonna\n
	+ make the news,\n
	+ is it?\n
	+ I've heard of a nearby\n
	+ place called the\n
	+ Mushroom Kingdom...\n
	+ A lot of stuff happens\n
	+ there!\n
	+ \n
	+ Have you ever been\n
	+ there, mister?
    10	= This is our first time\n
	+ in Delfino Plaza.\n
	+ \n
	+ Apparently, there's\n
	+ a statue of the Grand\n
	+ Pianta right here!...\n
	+ But it's just a big\n
	+ paint spill.\n
	+ \n
	+ Are we in the wrong\n
	+ place? Did the statue\n
	+ move somewhere?
    11	= This is awful!\n
	+ We came here\n
	+ to sightsee...\n
	+ But everything's\n
	+ a mess!\n
	+ \n
	+ Maybe we should\n
	+ just come back\n
	+ another time...\n
	+ I'm sure they'll get\n
	+ this cleaned up\n
	+ eventually... right?
    12	= I can't stand it!\n
	+ My wall is the most\n
	+ boring wall in town!\n
	+ If only I had a poster\n
	+ or something to spice\n
	+ it up a bit...\n
	+ But there's nothing\n
	+ worthy of putting a\n
	+ poster up right now!\n
	+ If only a wanted\n
	+ criminal was on\n
	+ the loose...\n
	+ Then my wall would\n
	+ be the most important\n
	+ wall in the plaza! Ha!
    13	= Hey there, traveler!\n
	+ Don't mind the Strollin'\n
	+ Stus everywhere...\n
	+ They come from Bianco\n
	+ Hills, and are usually\n
	+ pretty docile.\n
	+ However, there's been\n
	+ a bit of an infestation\n
	+ lately...\n
	+ At least it's not the\n
	+ Tramplin' Stu invasion\n
	+ of my ol' pop's day.\n
	+ Actually, if you can\n
	+ help get rid of them...\n
	+ \n
	+ I'm sure there'll be\n
	+ some benefit from it.\n
    14	= Hello, good sir!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I've just acquired\n
	+ the building across\n
	+ the channel.\n
	+ I own the local crate\n
	+ business. Everyone\n
	+ calls me the Crate Guy!\n
	+ I've got a shipment of\n
	+ crates waiting in\n
	+ Ricco Harbor...\n
	+ But I can't send them\n
	+ over yet due to the\n
	+ Strollin' Stus.\n
	+ Do you think you\n
	+ can help clear them\n
	+ out of the way?\n
    15	= Hey, pal! You\n
	+ keepin' happy?\n
	+ \n
	+ I've seen some crazy\n
	+ stuff over the years...\n
	+ \n
	+ But everything turns\n
	+ out alright in the end!\n
	+ \n
	+ And I have a feeling\n
	+ this won't be the last\n
	+ time we speak together!\n
	+ Take care, buddy!
    16	= Boy, life couldn't\n
	+ be sweeter right now!\n
	+ \n
	+ I'm so happy to finally\n
	+ see you again!
    17	= It's been awhile!\n
	+ We're gonna have\n
	+ so much fun together!
    18	= Oh boy! I just struck\n
	+ a deal with a tanooki!\n
	+ \n
	+ He's going to move\n
	+ into the boathouse\n
	+ over there...\n
	+ And we're going to\n
	+ turn Isle Delfino's boat\n
	+ business around!\n
	+ Soon, boats will be\n
	+ traveling all across the\n
	+ island! I can't wait!
    19	= If you've got a\n
	+ good eye, Mario...\n
	+ \n
	+ I'm sure you'll find\n
	+ some points of\n
	+ interest.\n
	+ Tell me all about\n
	+ your adventure\n
	+ when you get back!
    1a	= I've been repairing\n
	+ this ol' cannon for\n
	+ a long time now.\n
	+ But maybe it's\n
	+ time for a fresh\n
	+ coat of paint...\n
	+ Do you think it\n
	+ would look good\n
	+ in red?
    1b	= Delfino Plaza (E3)\n
	+ Approx. April 2002\n
	+ March 19, 2020\n
	+ \n
	+ Rhythm, Yoshi2\n
	+ and Inkstar
    1c	= If you somehow see\n
	+ this message...\n
	+ \n
	+ You got a lotta\n
	+ determination, you\n
	+ know that?\n
    1d	= Hey, partner! I...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Wait... It's you!!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ You're the guy who\n
	+ used to listen to my\n
	+ father play music!\n
	+ What're you doing\n
	+ here?! And how are\n
	+ you still so young?!\n
	+ ...Wait...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ You're not from my\n
	+ father's time, are you?\n
	+ \n
	+ You must be from the\n
	+ near future right?\n
	+ \n
	+ ...E. Gadd? I've heard\n
	+ of him. He built a time\n
	+ machine? Far out!\n
	+ Wait... That means I\n
	+ might see you again\n
	+ soon!\n
	+ Gee, mister. It's\n
	+ always nice when\n
	+ you're around!\n
	+ What do I mean,\n
	+ "Listen to my\n
	+ father's music"?\n
	+ Eh... You'll find out\n
	+ soon enough.\n
	+ \n
	+ Stay safe, bud.\n
	+ Good to see\n
	+ you again!
    1e	= It's been a year\n
	+ since I was\n
	+ stranded here.\n
	+ The boats that used\n
	+ to run around here\n
	+ are long gone.\n
	+ So there's no way for\n
	+ anyone to come find\n
	+ and rescue me.\n
	+ Once they get the\n
	+ boats back in running\n
	+ order...\n
	+ I hope no one forgets\n
	+ about me.
