     0	= 0
     1	= Aaauuugh!! This dish\n
	+ is on the brink of\n
	+ crisping over...\n
	+ I haven't got the right\n
	+ ingredient to finish\n
	+ the meal!\n
	+ If only I had\n
	+ something \z{7ff,200}spicy\z{7ff,0}...
     2	= Sigh...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ The soothing tones of\n
	+ a strong piano always\n
	+ seem to take me back.\n
	+ Bygone days of young\n
	+ love and passionate\n
	+ heartthrob.\n
	+ I could've been his.\n
	+ Sometimes I wonder\n
	+ why I walked away...?\n
	+ Yet here I am again,\n
	+ playing for yesterday.\n
	+ Yearning so long...\n
	+ I feel as though I'm\n
	+ with him once more.
     3	= I'm glad you're\n
	+ enjoying everything\n
	+ so far!\n
	+ I spent a long time\n
	+ saving up for\n
	+ this trip.
     4	= If you know what's\n
	+ good for ya, you'll\n
	+ scram.
     5	= I think my food is...\n
	+ slightly undercooked,\n
	+ heh-heh.\n
	+ Mind passing the word\n
	+ along to the chef?\n
	+ \n
	+ He did seem a little\n
	+ stressed out, now that\n
	+ I think about it.
     6	= What a mess!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Nobody came in to\n
	+ work because they're\n
	+ all sick of the chef.\n
	+ Short Stuff over there\n
	+ keeps barking orders\n
	+ at everyone.\n
	+ Maybe that new guy\n
	+ is laying the pressure\n
	+ down? Who knows.\n
	+ But it's all "chop chop"\n
	+ this, and "chop chop"\n
	+ that!\n
	+ If he doesn't lay\n
	+ off the overbearing\n
	+ overburderns...\n
	+ I'll "chop chop" chase\n
	+ that little chef right\n
	+ outta this big kitchen!
     7	= Listen to the way\n
	+ she plays...\n
	+ \n
	+ Lonely, isn't it?\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I know I could be a\n
	+ good partner for her.\n
	+ \n
	+ But she never seems\n
	+ to have the time.\n
	+ \n
	+ I just want to see\n
	+ her smile.
     8	= The men in black\n
	+ try to cramp my style,\n
	+ but I fear no one!\n
	+ ...Still, better to be\n
	+ safe than sorry.\n
	+ \n
	+ I've got a challenge\n
	+ for you, but you'll\n
	+ have to wait.\n
	+ Come back once those\n
	+ bullies are humbled\n
	+ and we can play!
     9	= None of the boys are\n
	+ around right now.\n
	+ \n
	+ Can't play poker,\n
	+ can't play pool...\n
	+ Whatta waste!\n
	+ Get outta here,\n
	+ I'm not in the mood.
     a	= Bah! Now I have to\n
	+ get started on the\n
	+ next one!\n
	+ Where's my staff??
     b	= Have you ever seen\n
	+ a place this fancy?\n
	+ \n
	+ I wish I could bring\n
	+ the wife and kids to\n
	+ live here forever!
     c	= Don't ask.
     d	= There's a \z{7ff,400}Shine Sprite\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ locked in my room.\n
	+ \n
	+ Can you hear it\n
	+ twinkling?\n
	+ \n
	+ I lost my key and\n
	+ the staff can't find\n
	+ the spares anywhere.\n
	+ Maybe you can get\n
	+ in through the fire\n
	+ escape in the back?
     e	= There's a ghastly\n
	+ draft coming through\n
	+ that vent.\n
	+ I can almost hear\n
	+ music through it...!\n
	+ \n
	+ No, not the piano\n
	+ downstairs. It sounds\n
	+ like... \z{7ff,500}a-capella\z{7ff,0}.
     f	= Don't you have\n
	+ anything better to do?
    10	= My best friend and I\n
	+ are touring the island\n
	+ together!\n
	+ She'll be arriving\n
	+ soon, and we plan to\n
	+ crash here all night.\n
	+ It's the party life\n
	+ for us! Whee-hee!
    11	= Wahoooo!! So many\n
	+ great games to play-\n
	+ I can't decide!\n
	+ I really wanna try that\n
	+ one in the corner.\n
	+ \n
	+ But it seems to be\n
	+ out of order currently.
    12	= Welcome to Hotel\n
	+ Lacrima! Please enjoy\n
	+ your stay.\n
	+ All we ask is that you\n
	+ remain on your best\n
	+ behavior around here!\n
	+ Please. Really. Eyes\n
	+ are watching.\n
	+ \n
	+ Huh?\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Don't mind the \z{7ff,300}blue\n
	+ coin\z{7ff,0} ice block.\n
	+ \n
	+ Those get shipped to\n
	+ all reception desks\n
	+ around the island.\n
	+ I'm sure you've seen\n
	+ one on the airstrip.\n
	+ Don't ask me why.
    13	= Everything is truly\n
	+ divine. I can't imagine\n
	+ a more romantic night.
    14	= If you know what's\n
	+ good for ya, you'll\n
	+ scram.
