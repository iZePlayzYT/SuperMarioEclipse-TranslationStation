     0	= I don't think this old\n
	+ shrine is gonna last\n
	+ much longer.\n
	+ Every year the lava\n
	+ slowly erodes the\n
	+ gravel path.\n
	+ A single natural force\n
	+ could be enough to\n
	+ wipe it all out.\n
	+ You don't suppose\n
	+ one will happen soon,\n
	+ do you?
     1	= Heading back out to\n
	+ Delfino Plaza?
     2	= 2
     3	= Good day, traveller!\n
	+ This is \z{7ff,400}Fire Shrine\z{7ff,0}.\n
	+ \n
	+ Shine Sprites are born\n
	+ in the lava pool here\n
	+ under the volcano top.\n
	+ When the sun shines\n
	+ down through the\n
	+ hole onto the altar...\n
	+ ...and the island\n
	+ is in balance and\n
	+ at peace...\n
	+ ...then a newborn\n
	+ Shine arises from\n
	+ the bubbling heat!\n
	+ We've counted \z{7ff,500}239\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ Shine Sprites to date.\n
	+ \n
	+ The next one is set\n
	+ to arrive any day now.\n
	+ \n
	+ But with the state of\n
	+ the island and the\n
	+ Shine Sprites gone?\n
	+ This might be the end\n
	+ of Fire Shrine...
     4	= 4
     5	= Why is it always\n
	+ strollin' stus??\n
	+ \n
	+ First they infested the\n
	+ towns, now they're in\n
	+ the temple?\n
	+ Where are they all\n
	+ coming from??
     6	= 6
     7	= Believe it or not,\n
	+ these mudboats are\n
	+ even resistant to lava!\n
	+ They can't touch a\n
	+ single wall, yeah...\n
	+ \n
	+ But hey! Lava-proof!\n
	+ That counts for\n
	+ something right?
     8	= 8
     9	= When all work is said\n
	+ and done, we pay our\n
	+ respects at the altar.\n
	+ It's customary to let\n
	+ the Shine Sprites know\n
	+ how much we care!\n
	+ But I don't think they\n
	+ feel very appreciated\n
	+ as of late...

     c	= 12
     d	= 13
     e	= 14
     f	= The Shine Sprites\n
	+ really fortified their\n
	+ old temple!\n
	+ This place could\n
	+ withstand any attack\n
	+ now, heh.
    10	= Heading back out to\n
	+ Delfino Plaza?
    11	= 2
    12	= You've truly touched\n
	+ all our hearts. We're\n
	+ in debt to you!\n
	+ Did you notice the\n
	+ \z{7ff,400}Shine Gate\z{7ff,0}?\n
	+ \n
	+ That legendary glow\n
	+ has only been seen\n
	+ once in history!\n
	+ It's the Shine Sprites'\n
	+ way of thanking you\n
	+ for the island harmony.\n
	+ And truly- we all sing\n
	+ with them! You'll be\n
	+ in our wishes.
    13	= 4
    14	= Look, I love strollin'\n
	+ stus as much as the\n
	+ next Pianta...\n
	+ ...but all the Shines\n
	+ are back now. Can't\n
	+ the stus just go home?
    15	= 6
    16	= And still, the\n
	+ mudboats live on-\n
	+ wahaha!!
    17	= 8
    18	= Now that all the\n
	+ Shines have returned,\n
	+ it's time to party!\n
	+ We're gonna throw\n
	+ a huge festival to\n
	+ welcome them back.
